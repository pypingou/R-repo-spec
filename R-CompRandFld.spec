%description
The aim of this package is to collect a set of procedures for the analysis
of Random Fields by Composite Likelihood methods. Spatial analysis often
involves dealing with large dataset. Therefore even simple studies may be
too computationally demanding. Composite likelihood based methods are
emerging as useful tools for mitigating such computational problems and
show satisfactory results when compared with other techniques such as, for
example the tapering method. Moreover, composite likelihood (and related
quantities) have some good properties similar to those of the standard
